<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `expr` (String) The LogQL query.
- `ref_id` (String) A unique identifier for the query within the list of targets.
In server side expressions, the refId is used as a variable name to identify results.
By default, the UI will assign A->Z; however setting meaningful names may be useful.

### Optional

- `editor_mode` (String)
- `hide` (Boolean) true if query is disabled (ie should not be returned to the dashboard)
Note this does not always imply that the query should not be executed since
the results from a hidden query may be used as the input to other queries (SSE etc)
- `instant` (Boolean, Deprecated) @deprecated, now use queryType.
- `legend_format` (String) Used to override the name of the series.
- `max_lines` (Number) Used to limit the number of log rows returned.
- `query_type` (String) Specify the query flavor
TODO make this required and give it a default
- `range` (Boolean, Deprecated) @deprecated, now use queryType.
- `resolution` (Number, Deprecated) @deprecated, now use step.
- `step` (String) Used to set step value for range queries.

### Read-Only

- `rendered_json` (String) This datasource rendered as JSON
